## About Me ##

I am a graduate student at the University of San Francisco in the Master's program in Analytics. Before joining this program, I worked for over three years at Optimedia, an advertising agency, where I did data analytics for online advertising. I got my undergraduate degree in Applied Mathematics (BS) at the University of California, Davis.
